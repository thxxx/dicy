    Hello, we are the Dice team. I write for the first time about what we're doing. <br/>The reason for writing is to let people who have similar thoughts know our thoughts.<br/><br/>

We had provided deep learning based B2B search Saas in the form of development and demo for 2 months to enable semantic search. Currently, we are developing new services by pivoting to see the speed of growth of deep learning and the impact that will occur in the future. <br/><br/>

<strong>Our goal is to create an AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) assistant that can assist people in their daily lives in the next 15 years.</strong> To achieve this goal, they are breaking down the progress into several stages and starting with the creation of a Quora-like platform using conversational AI.<br/><br/>

<strong>We provide a platform with <span>AI experts for each area with superior knowledge.</span> People can ask questions and get answers easily and quickly through conversations.</strong> Our main focus is on solving the problem of "online fatigue" that results from the time and effort required to sift through vast amounts of information on the internet. <br/><br/>

Our service utilizes advanced deep learning techniques, including a new foundation model (language model) pre-training algorithm that allows for low parameter models with better performance, lower cost and faster latency speed, to provide users with expert-level answers to their questions, as well as summaries and recommendations for products and services. In the future, we plan to expand our service to include a full-featured online assistant, ultimately building AGI (including hardware) which will be able to do everything in online and offline. <br/><br/>

I'm sure it's the most valuable service for anyone who doesn't get the information they need because they don't have the experts around them, and who feels tired online looking for the information they need with too much information.<br/><br/>

<strong>First</strong>, we are currently engaged in research to create a more powerful model. Our primary research focus is on creating high-performance language models with 100x fewer parameters. The current language models are known as "ultra-large langauge models" with a large number of parameters. This leads to problems such as slow speed and high cost, which makes an unsustainable business model and does not provide a great user experience. We are researching on the question of "Why current LLM's are giant parameter models?" and "How to solve these issues" and will provide more detailed thoughts and directions in their next article.<br/><br/>

<strong>Secondly</strong>, we are working on building models with more diverse user-computer interactions and online action ability including reservation and paying. To better understand user's question and provide better answers, we aim to research other domains that can help user experience like accepting inputs such as photos, performing specific actions, providing references for answers, and enabling answers that are based on the latest information. We work on developing various features such as truthful and harmless, multi-modal, step by step reasoning, video understanding, answers with generated image, etc.<br/><br/>

<strong>Thirdly</strong>, and most importantly, we are user-centric. We always think in a user-driven way. Although there are many things to do from a technical perspective, we will continue to have ways to confirm the user's needs and gain insights in parallel. To do this, we have quickly made and launched two products.<br/><br/>

<strong>Describe what your company does in 50 characters or less.</strong><br /><br/>
- Quora through conversational AI<br />
<br />
<strong>What is your company going to make? Please describe your product and what it does or will do.</strong><br />
<br />
We are building Quora, where is AIs which are expertise in specific areas answer on a variety of topics. We provide a platform with AI experts for each area with superior knowledge. People can ask questions and get answers easily and quickly through conversations. Our main focus is on solving the problem of "online fatigue" that results from the time and effort required to sift through vast amounts of information on the internet. Our service utilizes advanced deep learning techniques, including a new foundation model (language model) pre-training algorithm that allows for low parameter models with better performance, lower cost and faster latency speed, to provide users with expert-level answers to their questions, as well as summaries and recommendations for products and services. In the future, we plan to expand our service to include a full-featured online assistant, ultimately building AGI (including hardware) which will be able to do everything in online and offline.<br />
<br/><br />
<strong> Who writes code, or does other technical work on your product? Was any of it done by a non-founder? Please explain.</strong><br />
<br />
We all write the all of the code including front-end, back-end, and deep learning.<br />
<br/><br />
<strong> How long have the founders known one another and how did you meet? Have any of the founders not met in person?</strong><br />
<br />
We've known each other for about a year and used the same shared office with different teams. There are no founders who haven't met in person. We work in the same place every day(24/7) until 4 a.m.<br />
<br /><br/>
<strong> How far along are you?</strong><br />
<br />
To launch a superior our product, we need to develop advanced and expensive deep learning technology (LM), which requires a lot of money. So, we have recently launched two products that can be easily made without advanced own technology to gain user insights - an "AI expert" who listens to users' concerns and suggests solutions, and a web browser feature that allows users to ask for links and have the "AI expert" read them and find what the user wants. We are using these products to understand what concerns users have and what links they visit to inform our decision on which domains to expand the "AI expert" to. In terms of deep learning research, we are focusing on developing advanced deep learning technology (LLM) that requires 10 times fewer parameters while maintaining current performance. We are looking for ways to reduce parameters by efficiently conducting pre-training through reinforcement learning rather than using the existing LLM method. We are currently experimenting with deep learning algorithms by reducing models to small sizes (125M to 350M) that cannot be commercialized yet. In the future, we plan to expand the service to include features such as up-to-date information reflection, multi-modal understanding of images, and actions such as booking and payment.<br />
<br/><br />
<strong> How long have each of you been working on this? How much of that has been full-time? Please explain.</strong><br />
<br />
We started our own business with different teams for about a year and decided to do the current idea together with the same team from November 2022.<br />
Before this idea, I and Co-Founder made semantic search SaaS for B2B together for about 2 months.<br />
<br /><br/>
<strong> Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making?</strong><br />
<br />
We choose to work on this product because we noticed a problem with "online fatigue" - the pain and waste of time and effort that comes with processing vast amounts of information online. We believe that the main reason for this is the unidirectional interaction between humans and computers online, compared to the bidirectional interaction in the real world. With the emergence of new technologies, we saw an opportunity to reform the human-computer interaction method, and we believe this is a step towards AGI and a positive impact on society.<br />
<br />
We have domain expertise in this area, with team members having experience in deep learning research and publications, building virtual avatars and chatbot systems, winning deep learning competitions, and consulting for companies on DL-based semantic search API. The following is a list of things that prove this.  *Younggeun Kim has a lot of experience publishing deep learning papers as the first author at the Top Tier Conference like CVPR (They are mainly papers related to the field of generation). *Also Younggeun Kim built virtual avatar for Minds Labs.Inc as deep learning engineer and scientist for two years, mainly researching and making DL face swapping algorithms. *Younggeun Kim has an experience of pre-training large model at NUUA Inc *Hojin Kim has developed a deep learning-based chatbot system in the past. *We have a lot of experience in participating in South Korea and Global deep learning competitions and winning first place (ex. Competition in CVPR). *In addition, the Dice team consulted and provided APIs to companies that wanted to apply DL based semantic search API before coming up with the current idea. Also we have connections to some of the leading experts in this field, and we plan to recruit them to join our team.<br />
<br />
We know that there is a strong demand for our technology, and our team is well-equipped to bring it to fruition. We have first-hand experience with the problems of "online fatigue" and have developed software solutions to address it (e.g. we frequently find ourselves spending a significant amount of time searching for information related to code or AI, whether it be through Google searches or asking common sense questions like "What should I do for a stomachache?.”). This problem is not only something we experience but also a common pain point that we see many people expressing on online platforms such as Quora, stack overflow, and reddit. We plan to gather more user insights through these solutions to further improve our product and meet the demands of the market.<br />
